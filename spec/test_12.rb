#ENHANCEMENT 2
# Units start off alive but they die if their HP hits 0 or lower. This is usually 
# a result of receiving damage from combat.
# Implementation: Define a method dead? on the Unit class. We add it to Unit instead 
# of Footman for example b/c all units can die, not just footman or peasants.
